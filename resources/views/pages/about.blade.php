          <p>My Name is Michael Mattini. I am a veganism advocate, a musician, writer, comedian, technology obsessed douchebag out of Austin, Texas</p>
          <p class=“mb-0”>This site honestly doesn't have much purpose other than being a project to learn PHP and laravel. So if it goes down or is broken, it's ok. I'm not dead. I'm just working on it.</p>

          <p class=“mb-0”>Hugs and kisses. -M</p>
